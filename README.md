## Authentication
1. Connection with server is established via https and SSL cert.
2. User enters their username and password on the client side.
3. Username and password and encoded via Base64.
- look into better solution than Base64.
4. Encoded credentials are sent to server via web API.
5. Server decrypts credentials.
6. Server hashes provided password.
7. Server compares stored username and hashed password in its database.
8. If credentials are verified server sends client a JWT for Authorization.
9. Client recives JWT and saves it in local storage.
10. After client recives a valid JWT it will request page information from server.
11. If server recives a valid JWT in its request, it will provide requested content.
12. Once authenticated client side takes master password and hashes it in SHA256.
13. Client uses current devices UUID to make a SHA256 hash.
14. The hashed UUID is then converted into an AES key to encrypt the hashed master password.
15. The encrypted hash master password is then saved in local storage.
16. When user requests to decrypt a password (all happens client side)
  - 1. System hashes system UUID and converts it to make AES key.
  - 2. System pulls encrypted master password from local storage and uses UUID key to decrypt.
  - 3. System uses decrypted master password hash to make users AES decryption key.
  - 4. System uses users key to decrypt their password.
